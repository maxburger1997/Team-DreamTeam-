#### Description:

Repository for the Plankton assignment for the Machine Learning Project of the Minor AI 2022. In four weeks, we tried to train a model to classify a set of plankton images as accurately as possible. Data and assignment can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl. The final model achieved an accuracy of 74%, when splitting the training data set into a 70/30 split of training and validation data.

#### Structure of the repository:

The repository is divided into three folders, one for the code, one for the report, and one for the confusion matrices for each version of the model. In the code folder you can find the code for each milestone version of our model, with all relevant code cells included. Each chapter in the report represents a new milestone, so all experiments per milestone can be found there.
